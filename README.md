# Introduction

Lumina is a highly extensible, component based and high performance PHP framework. 

The framework focuses on meeting basic principles that result on high quality standards, reduced development time and easier maintenance. These are: security, performance, stability and consistency.

As part of Neticle's "Incubator" program, Lumina is actively maintained and used in the development of most of our web based projects.

The framework is available for free, for personal and commercial use, with additional support and training  paid services provided by Neticle (http://www.neticle.pt/).
