# Introduction

Lumina is a highly extensible, component based and high performance PHP framework. 

The framework focuses on meeting basic principles that result on high quality standards, reduced development time and easier maintenance. These are: security, performance, stability and consistency.

Lumina is actively maintained and used in the development of most of our web based projects.

The framework is available for free, with additional consultancy, support and training services provided by [Neticle](http://www.neticle.com/).

## Documentation

Documentation is generated by [ApiGen](https://github.com/apigen/apigen) and available in HTML format at the `docs/` directory.

One way to easily consult the documentation without copying it to the webroot is to bring up a quick HTTP server using python:

```sh
cd docs/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You can then view the documentation by accessing `http://localhost:8000/`.

### Manual generation

If you want to manually generate the documentation, simply run the following command:

```sh
php apigen.phar generate
```
